# Schedwin
WPF Airline booking/reservation system and aircraft planning tool

This was a port I did from Visual Basic. It is basically a system that sucks in passenger data from another reservation system as well as allow you to to book seats on a small
airline charter company. The application keeps track of passenber bookings, allows schedulers to assign passengers to aircraft, plan aircraft over routes on a daily basis. It also 
keeps pilot details and provides pilot planning capabilities . Additionally it serves as an aircraft data repository keeping track of all aircraft technical, maintainence 
and geo tracking data.

The system also has reporting capabilities to report on passenger numbers, aircraft details and financial accountability .
